The aim of the project is to use the dataset that was previously scraped on Immoweb Belgium and create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales. This repository provides the process of data cleaning, data formating, model selection and application, and model evaluation.

### The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" asks you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales. Take the dataset that was previously scraped, preprocessed and analyzed. Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.

### Learning Objectives

- [X] Be able to apply a linear regression in a real context.
- [X] Be able to preprocess data for machine learning.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Misterkadrix/challenge-regression.git
``` 
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install [required library]
```

### The process

**Data Preprocessing**

The data cleaning and preprocessing includes handling with;
- [X] Missing values
- [X] Duplicate rows
- [X] Outliers
- [X] Conversion of categorical data
  
**Data Formatting**
- [X] Splitting the dataset for train and test set.

**Model Selection and Evaluation**
- [X] Simple Linear Regression
- [X] Multivariate Linear Regression


### Visuals

What we will see is a graph with the correlation between our target and features.
