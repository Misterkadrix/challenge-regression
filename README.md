## Description

We have create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales and apply a linear regression.
We did take data from Immo Web, clean the dataset and then use it to test it on our model.  
Those data will be used to preprocess it for our machine Learning


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Misterkadrix/challenge-regression.git
``` 
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install [required library]
```

## Output

What we will see is a graph with the correlation between our target and features. 

## How it works
<h3> Data Cleaning </h3>
For the Data Set we had to clean by deleting   

- Duplicates  
- NAN  
- Text Data  
- Features that have too strong correlation between them  
  
<h3> Data Formatting </h3>
Format the Data for machine learning  

  - Divide your X and your y  
  - Divide your dataset for training and testing. (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)  

The model works with our DataSet.. Each values coming from that one will be transform into X and Y and be used on our MODEL who will predict the prices of houses.
